### Dislay output in a terminal
#### 'Echo and printf' (try_echo.sh)
I learned how to print in the terminal using `echo` and `printf`.
I also learned the difference between no quotes, 
double quotes nd single quotes.
The example fromt he book was not complete.

In order to enable escape characters, wcho needs the option -e.

I learned format printing with `printf` (left alignment, width, number of
floating points etc)

I also learned how to print colored output.
